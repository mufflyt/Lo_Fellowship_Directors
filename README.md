# Lo_Chairs_vs_Residency_directors

ACGME_all_OBGYN_fellowships - I was able to write code that scraped the ACGME fellowship directors. After that I uploaded the names to Mturk that gave me the NPI numbers.  

* Shilpa found the names of the OBGYN and Urology chairs.  From that we were able to use mechanical turk to search their NPI, PPI, and healthgrades.com age.  Lo and Iris pulled the ACGME data by hand for Urology and OBGYN residencies.  

* Most of the data munging was done in exploratory.io in the Lo_and_Muffly project, Chair vs. Residency folder, Compiled Programs from Shilpa.  
* Subspecialty for OBGYN can be found in GOBA.  Subspecialty for Urology can be found in ABU.  But only FPMRS were on the ABU site so we had to look at the Urology Care Foundation for subspecialty as well.
